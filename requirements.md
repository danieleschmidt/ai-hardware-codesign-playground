# AI Hardware Co-Design Playground - Requirements

## Project Charter

### Problem Statement
Modern AI workloads require co-optimization of neural networks and hardware accelerators to achieve optimal performance, power efficiency, and cost. Traditional design flows treat software and hardware separately, leading to suboptimal solutions. This project provides an integrated environment for simultaneous optimization of AI models and their underlying hardware implementations.

### Success Criteria
1. **Unified Design Environment**: Single platform for model and hardware co-design
2. **Performance Targets**: Enable 10x improvement in performance-per-watt compared to CPU baselines
3. **Design Productivity**: Reduce accelerator design time from months to days
4. **Open Ecosystem**: Compatible with open-source tools (TVM, MLIR, OpenROAD, Sky130)
5. **Educational Impact**: Support academic research and teaching
