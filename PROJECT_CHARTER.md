- **Academic Gap**: Limited educational resources for hardware-software co-design

### Market Need
- Growing demand for specialized AI accelerators across industries
- Need for rapid prototyping and iteration in AI chip design
- Educational demand for hands-on hardware design experience
- Research community needs for reproducible co-optimization studies

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Accessibility**: Enable users with basic programming knowledge to design custom AI accelerators
