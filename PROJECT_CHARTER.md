# AI Hardware Co-Design Playground - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

The AI Hardware Co-Design Playground is an integrated development environment that enables simultaneous optimization of neural networks and hardware accelerators. This platform addresses the critical gap between AI model development and hardware implementation, providing researchers and engineers with tools to co-optimize performance, power efficiency, and cost.

## Problem Statement

Modern AI workloads require specialized hardware accelerators to achieve optimal performance and energy efficiency. However, traditional design flows treat software (AI models) and hardware development separately, leading to:

- **Suboptimal Performance**: Models optimized for general-purpose processors don't leverage custom hardware efficiently
- **Design Complexity**: Separate optimization of model and hardware requires multiple iterations
- **Time-to-Market**: Hardware design cycles of 12-18 months don't align with rapid AI model evolution
- **Accessibility Barriers**: Hardware design expertise is scarce, limiting innovation to specialized teams
