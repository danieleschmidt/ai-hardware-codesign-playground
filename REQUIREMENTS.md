# Requirements Specification

## Project Overview

**ai-hardware-codesign-playground** is an interactive environment for co-optimizing neural networks and hardware accelerators, enabling design of custom AI chips alongside the models that run on them.

### Problem Statement

The AI hardware design space lacks accessible tools for co-optimizing neural network models and their underlying hardware implementations. Existing solutions are either proprietary, domain-specific, or require extensive hardware design expertise, creating barriers for innovation in AI accelerator development.

### Success Criteria

- **Performance**: Enable co-design workflows that achieve 10x improvement in performance/power efficiency over baseline implementations
- **Accessibility**: Reduce hardware design expertise barrier by 80% through high-level abstractions and templates
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and hardware tools (TVM, MLIR)
- **Reproducibility**: All generated designs must be verifiable through simulation and synthesis flows

### Scope

#### In Scope

#### Out of Scope
- Full chip physical design (place & route is supported but not optimized)
- Production-ready silicon implementation (research/prototype focus)
- Real-time operating system integration
- Mobile/edge device deployment (focus on accelerator IP cores)
