# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-27

## Context
We need a way to record the rationale behind architectural decisions made during the development of the AI Hardware Co-Design Playground. This helps maintain context for future developers and enables informed evolution of the system.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will be numbered sequentially and stored in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Historical Context**: Future developers can understand why decisions were made
- **Decision Transparency**: Clear documentation of trade-offs and alternatives considered
- **Change Management**: Easier to modify or reverse decisions with full context
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Team alignment on architectural principles

### Negative
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Additional documentation to maintain
- **Process Overhead**: Time required to write ADRs for each decision

## Implementation
- ADRs will follow the format: `NNNN-short-title.md`
- Each ADR must include: Status, Date, Context, Decision, and Consequences
- ADRs will be reviewed as part of the standard code review process
- Superseded ADRs will be marked as "Superseded by ADR-XXXX"
