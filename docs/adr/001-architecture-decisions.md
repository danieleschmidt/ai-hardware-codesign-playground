# ADR-001: Core Architecture Decisions

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Deciders**: Technical Team  

## Context

We need to establish the foundational architecture for the AI Hardware Co-Design Playground that will support model analysis, hardware generation, co-optimization, and implementation flows while remaining extensible and maintainable.

## Decision

### 1. Layered Architecture with Service-Oriented Design

We will implement a layered architecture with the following tiers:
- **User Interface Layer**: Web dashboard, CLI, Python SDK
- **Application Layer**: Workflow engine, optimization engine, simulation manager
- **Core Services**: Model analyzer, hardware generator, co-optimizer
- **Backend Services**: RTL generation, synthesis, verification, deployment

**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns, easier testing, better maintainability, and supports horizontal scaling.

### 2. Python as Primary Development Language

We will use Python 3.9+ as the primary language for the platform core, with TypeScript for frontend components and SystemVerilog for hardware generation.

**Rationale**: 
- Rich ecosystem for ML/AI development
- Excellent integration with existing tools (TVM, MLIR)
- Strong typing support with type hints
- Large community and extensive libraries

### 3. Microservices Architecture for Backend

Core services will be implemented as loosely coupled microservices with REST APIs and message queues for communication.

**Rationale**:
- Independent scaling of compute-intensive services
- Technology diversity (different languages for different services)
- Fault isolation and resilience
- Easier deployment and updates

### 4. Template-Based Hardware Generation

Hardware architectures will be implemented as parameterizable templates rather than fixed designs.

**Rationale**:
- Rapid design space exploration
- Code reuse across similar architectures
- Easier customization for specific workloads
- Clear abstraction between specification and implementation

### 5. Multi-Objective Optimization Framework

The optimization engine will support multiple objectives (performance, power, area) with Pareto frontier analysis.

**Rationale**:
- Real-world design constraints are multi-dimensional
- Enables informed design trade-offs
- Supports different optimization goals for different use cases
- Research-grade optimization capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Modular, extensible architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Supports parallel development
- Facilitates testing and debugging
- Enables horizontal scaling

### Negative
- Additional complexity in system integration
- Network latency between services
- More complex deployment and monitoring
- Potential for inconsistent APIs across services

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, lower latency, easier debugging
- **Cons**: Difficult to scale, technology lock-in, harder to maintain
- **Decision**: Rejected due to scalability concerns

### Fixed Hardware Designs
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, predictable performance
- **Cons**: Limited flexibility, difficult customization
- **Decision**: Rejected to support research and exploration

### Single-Objective Optimization
- **Pros**: Simpler algorithms, faster convergence
- **Cons**: Doesn't reflect real design constraints
- **Decision**: Rejected to support realistic design scenarios

## Implementation Notes

1. Start with a monolithic prototype to validate concepts
2. Gradually extract services as functionality stabilizes
3. Use API contracts and interface definitions early
4. Implement comprehensive testing at service boundaries
5. Plan for backward compatibility as APIs evolve
