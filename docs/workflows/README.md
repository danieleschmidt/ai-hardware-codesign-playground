# Workflow Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the GitHub Actions workflow requirements for the AI Hardware Co-Design Playground project.

## Required Workflows

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Continuous Integration**: Run tests, linting, type checking on every PR
- **Deployment**: Automated staging and production deployments
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency vulnerability checks
- **Code Quality**: Coverage reporting and analysis

### Required Manual Setup
The following workflows require repository admin permissions:

1. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Require PR reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Restrict pushes to main branch

2. **GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment pipeline
   - `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Security checks

3. **Repository Settings**
   - Enable Dependabot security updates
   - Configure merge requirements
   - Set up deployment environments

## Implementation Notes

Workflow files must be created manually due to security restrictions.
See [SETUP_REQUIRED.md](../SETUP_REQUIRED.md) for detailed setup instructions.
