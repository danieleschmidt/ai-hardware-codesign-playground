# 🚀 Production-Ready Workflow Activation Guide

**Repository:** ai-hardware-codesign-playground  
**SDLC Maturity Level:** Enterprise-Grade (Ready for Activation)  
**Workflow Permission Issue:** Resolved with Manual Activation Process  

## 🔒 Permission Context

Due to GitHub App security restrictions, workflows cannot be automatically created in `.github/workflows/`. This is a **security feature** that prevents unauthorized workflow modifications. The production-ready workflows are provided in `docs/workflows/production-ready/` and require manual activation.

## 📋 Quick Activation Checklist

### Step 1: Copy Workflows to Active Directory
```bash
# Navigate to repository root
cd /path/to/ai-hardware-codesign-playground

# Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy production-ready workflows
cp docs/workflows/production-ready/* .github/workflows/

# Commit the activation
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "feat: activate enterprise-grade SDLC workflows

🚀 Activate comprehensive CI/CD, security, and automation workflows

- ci.yml: Multi-platform CI/CD with comprehensive testing
- security.yml: Complete security scanning suite  
- release.yml: Automated semantic releases
- performance.yml: Performance testing and monitoring
- dependency-update.yml: Automated dependency management

Resolves workflow permission restrictions by manual activation.
"
```

### Step 2: Configure Repository Secrets
Navigate to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` and add:

#### Required Secrets
| Secret Name | Description | Required For |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Automatically provided | All workflows |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Code coverage reporting | CI workflow |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Notifications (optional) | CI workflow |

#### Optional Secrets (Enhanced Features)
| Secret Name | Description | Required For |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| `NPM_TOKEN` | NPM package publishing | Release workflow |
| `PYPI_TOKEN` | PyPI package publishing | Release workflow |
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Docker Hub publishing | Release workflow |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Docker Hub publishing | Release workflow |
| `SONAR_TOKEN` | SonarQube analysis | Security workflow |

### Step 3: Enable Branch Protection Rules
```bash
# Use GitHub CLI to set branch protection (if available)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["Continuous Integration"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}' \
  --field restrictions=null
```

Or manually in GitHub UI:
1. Go to `Settings > Branches`
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable: "Require status checks", "Require pull request reviews"
4. Select: "Continuous Integration" check

### Step 4: Test Workflow Activation
```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/workflow-activation

# Make a small change
echo "# Workflow Test" >> TEST_WORKFLOW.md
git add TEST_WORKFLOW.md
git commit -m "test: verify workflow activation"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin test/workflow-activation
gh pr create --title "Test: Workflow Activation" --body "Testing activated workflows"
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Workflow Customization

#### Environment Variables
Each workflow supports customization through environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"        # Customize Python version
  NODE_VERSION: "18"            # Customize Node.js version
  POETRY_VERSION: "1.6.1"       # Customize Poetry version
```

#### Matrix Strategy Customization
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    # Add/remove versions as needed
```

#### Service Configuration
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15          # Customize PostgreSQL version
  redis:
    image: redis:7              # Customize Redis version
```

### Security Configuration

#### Required Permissions
Workflows require these permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write               # For releases and commits
  packages: write              # For container publishing
  security-events: write       # For security scanning
  issues: write                # For automated issue creation
  pull-requests: write         # For PR automation
```

#### SARIF Integration
Security tools automatically upload results to GitHub Security:
```yaml
- name: Upload SARIF Results
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
  with:
    sarif_file: security-results.sarif
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Workflow Monitoring
Once activated, monitor workflows through:

1. **GitHub Actions Tab:** Real-time workflow status
2. **Security Tab:** Security scan results and alerts
3. **Insights Tab:** Workflow performance and statistics
4. **Dependency Graph:** Dependency security overview

### Metrics Collection
The workflows integrate with repository metrics:

```bash
# Collect workflow metrics
./scripts/collect-metrics.sh --verbose

# Generate dashboard
./scripts/generate-dashboard.py .github/project-metrics.json

# Validate health
./scripts/repository-health-check.sh
```

### Dashboard Integration
Workflow results feed into the interactive dashboard:
- **Build Status:** Success/failure rates and trends
- **Security Metrics:** Vulnerability counts and resolution times
- **Performance Data:** Response times and regression detection
- **Dependency Health:** Update frequency and security status

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Workflow Permission Errors**
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```
**Solution:** Ensure repository has correct permissions in Settings > Actions > General

#### 2. **Secret Access Errors**
```
Error: Secret not found
```
**Solution:** Verify secrets are set in Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions

#### 3. **Service Connection Failures**
```
Error: Could not connect to PostgreSQL
```
**Solution:** Check service configuration and port mappings in workflow

#### 4. **Matrix Build Failures**
```
Error: Python 3.12 not found
```
**Solution:** Update matrix strategy or exclude unsupported combinations

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting repository secret:
```
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG = true
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG = true
```

### Workflow Validation
Validate workflow syntax before activation:
```bash
# Install act for local testing (optional)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Test workflow locally
act -j code-quality --dry-run
```
