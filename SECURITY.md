## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit (Python) and ESLint (JavaScript)
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- **Code Review**: Security-focused review for all contributions
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

### Infrastructure Security

- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for maintainers
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and alerting

### Development Security

- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration out of the box
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **Secret Management**: No secrets in code, secure secret storage
- **Container Security**: Minimal container images, regular base image updates

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Contributions

1. **Input Validation**
   ```python
   # Always validate and sanitize inputs
   def process_model_file(file_path: str) -> Model:
       if not is_valid_path(file_path):
           raise SecurityError("Invalid file path")
       
       if not file_path.endswith(('.onnx', '.pt', '.pb')):
           raise SecurityError("Unsupported file type")
   ```

2. **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets**
   ```python
   # Bad
   API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
   
   # Good
   API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
   if not API_KEY:
       raise EnvironmentError("API_KEY environment variable required")
   ```

3. **Safe File Operations**
   ```python
   # Use safe file operations
   def read_config_file(filename: str) -> Dict:
       safe_path = os.path.abspath(filename)
       if not safe_path.startswith(ALLOWED_CONFIG_DIR):
           raise SecurityError("Path traversal attempt detected")
   ```

### Dependencies

- Regularly update dependencies to latest secure versions
- Use `npm audit` and `pip-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Review dependency changes in pull requests

### Data Handling

- Minimize data collection and retention
- Implement data anonymization where possible
- Follow GDPR and other privacy regulations
- Secure disposal of sensitive data

## Known Security Considerations

### Model File Processing

**Risk**: Malicious model files could potentially execute arbitrary code

**Mitigation**:
- Sandboxed model loading and execution
- File type validation and signature checking
- Resource limits for model processing
- Regular security scanning of model parsing libraries

### Hardware Design Generation

**Risk**: Generated RTL could contain security vulnerabilities

**Mitigation**:
- Template validation and security review
- Static analysis of generated code
- Secure coding patterns in templates
- User education on secure hardware design

### Cloud Integration

**Risk**: Exposure of sensitive data in cloud environments

**Mitigation**:
- Encryption of all cloud communications
- Access controls and authentication
- Audit logging of cloud operations
- Regular security assessments

### Web Interface

**Risk**: Common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

**Mitigation**:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- CSRF protection tokens
- Input sanitization and output encoding
- Regular security testing

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Report received**: Acknowledge within 48 hours
2. **Validation**: Confirm and assess impact within 5 days
3. **Development**: Create and test fix
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinate public disclosure
5. **Release**: Deploy fix and publish advisory

### Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 30-day disclosure timeline
- **High/Medium vulnerabilities**: 90-day disclosure timeline
- **Low vulnerabilities**: 180-day disclosure timeline

### Recognition

We maintain a security hall of fame for researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- Public recognition (with permission)
- Security researcher swag
- Potential bug bounty (for significant findings)

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Project mailing list
- Release notes

### Update Process

1. **Security patches** are released as soon as possible
2. **Backwards compatibility** maintained where possible
3. **Migration guides** provided for breaking changes
4. **Automatic updates** recommended for patch releases

### Version Numbering

Security releases follow semantic versioning:
- **Patch releases** (e.g., 0.1.1 → 0.1.2) for security fixes
- **Minor releases** (e.g., 0.1.x → 0.2.0) for new security features
- **Major releases** (e.g., 0.x.x → 1.0.0) for breaking security changes
